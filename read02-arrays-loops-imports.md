**packages**
Packages a way to group and categorize the code you are writing, they physically place the defined code in a directory.
*package com.mambodata.utilities*
for example, would create and place your code in the /src/com/mambodata/utilities directory.  I would assume that references 
to classes in the same package/directory would not need to be qualified with the package location, while others would.


**import**
import bring in a library for use in the code.
import javax.swing.*; for example bring in all the classes from the javax.swing library *(but apparently, not the subclasses)*
import javax.swing.JEvent; bring in the javax.swing.JEvent (sub)class only;  There are apparently subclasses that are NOT brought in when importing the parent class.  These have to be imported in specifically.

you can also reference the library WITHOUT having to import it at the top of code, like this:

javax.swing.JEvent myEvent = new javax.swing.JEvent();
